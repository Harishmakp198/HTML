    <h1>MEAN STACK</h1>

    <p>MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS (or Angular), and Node.js)[1] is a free and open-source JavaScript software
        stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications.[2]

        Because all components of the MEAN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, MEAN applications can
        be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.</p> MEAN (MongoDB,
    Express.js, AngularJS (or Angular), and Node.js)[1] is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building
    dynamic web sites and web applications.[2]

    Though often compared directly to other popular web development stacks such as the LAMP stack, the components of the
    MEAN stack are higher-level including a web application presentation layer and not including an operating system
    layer.[3]

    The acronym MEAN was coined by Valeri Karpov.[4] He introduced the term in a 2013 blog post and the logo concept,
    initially created by Austin Anderson for the original MEAN stack LinkedIn group, is an assembly of the first letter
    of each component of the MEAN acronym.[5]
